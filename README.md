# PCAN: 3D Attention Map Learning Using Contextual Information for Point Cloud Based Retrieval (CVPR 2019) [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09793)

## Introduction
PCAN is an attention module for point cloud based retrieval, which can predict the significance of each local point feature based on
point context.
This work is base on [PointNetVLAD](https://github.com/mikacuy/pointnetvlad) and [Pointnet++](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2)
